* kidshell

  Basic shell. Supports running commands, ~export~, ~unset~, ~exit~ and ~cd~.
  Can do basic tilde(~~~, ~~user~), variable(~$HOME~) and arithmetic(~$[1 + 3]~)
  expansions as well as command substitution(~$(ls)~).

  NOTE: hw version doesn't support running commands from $PATH. (I don't want to
  reimplement ~execvp~)

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
